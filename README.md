<h1 align="center">ChemNLP-MaterialsAnalysis</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project extends the ChemNLP library to meet the complex challenges of materials chemistry through NLP. Created for a Master's thesis at the University of Paris, we aim to automate the classification and recognition of chemical documents using the latest NLP techniques for in-depth text analysis.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Extend ChemNLP with the latest NLP advancements.</li>
  <li>Employ advanced ML models for improved classification and entity recognition.</li>
  <li>Showcase the library's strength across diverse chemical datasets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Team</h2>
<p>Mentored by Mr. Nadif Mohamed, the team includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meryem Belkaid</li>
  <li>Abir Oumghar</li>
  <li>Hafsa Boanani</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Workflow</h2>

<h3>Data Preparation</h3>
<p>Employing arXiv and PubChem datasets to showcase ChemNLP's broad scientific text applications.</p>

<h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
<p>Integration of BERT embeddings for advanced chemical terminology insights and application of dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP.</p>
